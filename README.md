A Git Tutorial inspired by Hg Init
----------------------------------

I first began to understand distributed version control by reading Joel Spolski's excellent Hg Init tutorial (http://hginit.com).  Recently we have started the process of switching over to Git at work.  My boss asked if there was a good site for him (and others on our team) to start learning about Git.  Realizing from my experience that they need to understand the way DVCS change how you think about revision control and software configuration management, I thought back to how much I had learned from HG Init.  I thought that surely someone had created a similar tutorial for Git.  Unfortunately what I found in the Git space was a number of tutorials that are heavy on details and light on concepts.  It is these conceptual differences that I believe hang most people up.  So I have taken on the task of creating a starting point for understanding distributed version control, using Git commands rather than Mercurial (Hg) commands.  Though I was inspired by the Hg Init site, this site is definitely not a copy of that site with the appropriate Git commands substituted for the Mercurial ones.  Git and Mercurial are very similar, but they definitely chart a different course.  As a result this tutorial takes a different path through the material (and covers different material).  This should not be seen as a critique of the Hg Init site, but rather a requirement of the different mindset required to interact with a Git Repository.  If you are using Mercurial I strongly suggest that you go look at hginit.com.  If you will be using Git, then you are in the right place.
